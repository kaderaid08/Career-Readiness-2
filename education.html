        <p>Throughout my high school education, I've taken challenging AP classes and college classes such as AP Computer Science, AP Biology, Psychology 100, Criminal Justice and Math 120. I am in National Honors Society at The High School of Fashion Industries and in several clubs such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2!3! Dance Crew</li>
            <li>Modeling</li>
            <li>Fashion Cares</li>
            <li>Anti-Prom</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I have also participated in a work-based challenge in my software development major at Warby Parker. We learned how to create prototypes and come up with ideas to make the user experience at their company more interactive and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>I am aiming to continue my education in college, majoring in psychology or engineering. I plan to take more college and AP classes in the future and pursure a career in these fields. I also plan on participating in internships and experiences to better see how it is like in these fields.
