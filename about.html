        <img src="img/cat.png" class="img3">
        <p>I am a 17 year old student from Queens, NY attending the High School of Fashion Industries as a Software Development major. <br><br>
         I like playing volleyball, cats, and cafes. I also like to dance and visit libraries in my free time, and I am on a dance team.<br>
         <br> I also like researching about psychology and debating with my friends as well as creating and crafting different mechanical projects out of cardboard. I also like playing guitar and listening to music. </p>
